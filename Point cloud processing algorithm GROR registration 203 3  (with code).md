 The downloaded source code is added to vs, and pcl environment variables are added to compile and run. It also works well for point clouds with relatively low overlap rates  

 The overlap rate between the red target point cloud and the original point cloud is 50%, and the registration effect is good

#  III. Follow-up integration 

 It will be integrated into the column "PCL + QT" later.
